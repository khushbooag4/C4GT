## Project Description

The government school curriculum in India has been designed in a standardised manner for each grade. In a typical classroom, however, students are always at varying levels of comprehension and grasping power. There therefore, exists a need to personalise learning for students so that they can learn at a level suitable to them.

In order to tackle this problem for the **264 million +** students in government schools in India who need access to such personalised learning, Competency Passbook is currently being conceptualised as a comprehensive student engagement and learning record platform available to teachers, parents and students at all times.

## Project Goal

The project aims towards the development of a Competency Passbook (Ledger) on a private blockchain network of schools and educational institutions for awarding badges and certificates to students and act as a single source of truth for authenticity of these records.
